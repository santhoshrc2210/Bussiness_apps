# Bussiness_apps
I am making bussiness aps for a jewllery store. Wieght, wastage and labour charges are taken as inputs to calculate the cost of an item for given gold or silver price. 
Upto four items can be added, it can also calculate the price of a return item.
The second app will create a tax invoice and will be similar to the first app.
